Domainmodel for the yahtzee game. The main conceptual classes I found were, YahtzeeGame, Player, Dice, Rule, Score and ScoreSheet. 
My reasoning is this, the player plays the game. There were 1-5 players allowed. The player rolls 1-5 dices. The dices gets a value 1-6.
The game has 1 rule variant, the requirements states that there should be atlest two available so I think this class is important enough
to have in this model.
The score is the main objective of the game and what decides who/wins looses in the end. It is decided by the rules.
The score is then put in the scoresheet which is the central part for the state of the game.

The feedback I got from ws1 was that I focused to much on actors, kept to simplistic and did not really mirror the real world.
I tried to work with that in mind in this one.

Hope it is good enough!
Cheers!
